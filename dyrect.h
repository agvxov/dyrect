/* This header file defines with intuitive rectangle transformations.
 *
 * The intended purpose is to ease defining single screen interfaces.
 *  Layout engines are great, but very complex to implement and master.
 *  Static layouts on the other hand tend to get very ugly, verbose and bug prone.
 *  The idea is to have a very minimalistic abstraction layer,
 *   with easy to visualize operations.
 *  This solves readability and typo-ing x to y, while being widely usable,
 *   adaptable or even reimplementable within just a few minutes.
 *
 * No doubt someone somewhere has adapted a similar approach before,
 *  however to the best of my knowledge this is the first attempt
 *  to normalize it into a library.
 *  In case I'm wrong, please throw me an email. (agvxov@gmail.com)
