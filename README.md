# Dyrect
> DYnamic RECTangle layouts

Dyrect is a simple abstraction layer for single screen application layouts.

This implementation consists of a single header-only library.
Due to its simplicity,
porting to any other environment should not take longer than a few minutes.
Its value is not in the implementation,
but how it serves as a guide for an effective solution.

For the details, consult the [header](dyrect.h).
It has been commented appropriately.
To see Dyrect in practice with ncurses and raylib, consult the [examples](examples/) folder.
